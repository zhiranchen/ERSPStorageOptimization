ERSP Storage Optimization

This pin tool is written to identify redundant store instructions. To run this
program, navigate to the itrace_experiment directory. Then type in 'make'. Next,
to run the pin program, type in:

pin -t ~/ERSPStorageOptimization/pin-3.0-76991-gcc-linux/source/tools/itrace_ex
periment/obj-intel64/traceMemoryWrite.so -- ./test

where test is the C or C++ program you wish to find the redundant store
instructions.

If there are any problems running this, you might not have configured Pin
correctly on your device. Please refer to the Pin website to configure 
correctly.

Currently, the program prints all the immediate values and register values to
ImmediateOutput.txt. It includes the immediate value, instructor pointers, and
memory address. 

A tool to remove these redundant store instructions can be written to actually 
remove the store instructions and optimize the program.
